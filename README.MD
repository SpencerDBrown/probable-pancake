Spencer D Brown Week 2 Homework Readme


My first step was creating a wireframe for the general mock up of the portfolio.

After that I wrote out everything I needed information wise in HTML, from dividing up the header/hero/main/body and footer,
to filling in the info in the about me and work sections.

After the HTML was finalized and formatted the way I felt sufficed, I then started to tackle the CSS.
There were a few hiccups with making the flex boxes actually work within their constraints,
but after a bit of research and tinkering I figured them out! (most solutions are much simplert than you think!)
I then looked up a few different new tricks I could add with the ":hover" tool, I found out about opacity while hover
and that created a cool transition effect when hovering over the stock images. BUT there was a problem, when I hovered
over the image it would overlap on the title of the flex box, so I had to add a z-index to both elements to seperate them
in a layered sense.

Once done with the flex boxes I worked on aligning all text/nav links to format them the way I wanted to. As well as making 
sure the nav bar actually was linked to the ID's of the sections so when you clicked them they took you to where you need to go.

Lastly the footer, everything is linked aside from the phonenumber, I even thought it would be fun to link my artist profile
on both twitter/spotify to those buttons! Worked like a charm!

Overall the homework was a challenge but a good and welcomed one! I learned a lot and im excited for the next one!
